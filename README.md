# IS211_Assignment9

PROBLEMS:

For football_stats.py, the application seems to hang when there is a zero (NoneType) in the td_first column.  I don't know how to get the
program to ignore the zero value.

For apply_stock.py, I was not able to get data from the {"class":"historical-data_cell"} portion of the NASDAQ website.
